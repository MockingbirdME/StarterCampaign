## Scene One: Meeting With Sire Yakob Klees
The characters gather at The Pick and Key, a local tavern, at lunch time in response to a summons from local Land-Owner (lowest rank of Askelonian Lord), and suspected gang leader, Sire Yakob Klees.

As the character's enter there is a regular lunch crowd but no sign of of the Sire, if they ask the Cedren he'll inform them they are to wait and ask if they want food or ale while they do.  

After the characters have a chance to chat or gossip Rallin appears from the back room cleaning a long knife that appears to have blood on it and calls the party members in.

The back room is 20'x 30' with a number of small tables around the parameter and a small bar along part of the left wall, a single larger table in the center and two additional doors off the right rear and behind the bar. Klees is seated at the large table, Seera the bar looking on and a handful of guards, both Sapeen and Kaazt, standing around. The seat at the table closest the entrance is smeared with recently mopped up blood.

Klees bellows out a greeting and asks the party to take a seat, offering refreshments and calling for food.

After the party settles Klees explains how he had a important chest that was hidden in a shipment that got raided by The Baker's Sons. The chest was arcanely locked and he knows the mages would charge him more than he's willing to pay for it's return and he's unwilling to start a war by going after it himself but he knows of individual who was involved and may know where the chest where being kept; Leorg is an ally of the Order but not a mage himself, he's cautious and knows Klees's men but not the party. Leorg is known to frequent a local tavern and gambling hall called The Hard Six.

## Scene Two: Tracking Leorg
The party should investigate Leorg's whereabouts, ultimately tracking him to a back room card table at The Hard Six. Leorg will be drunk and, if not confronted first head to the back ally to relieve himself. The party can apprehend and question him however they see fit. He wont be willingly forthcoming with the information but will brag about the raided caravan if he feels he's being praised or will quickly spill his guts if threatened with violence.

Leorg will reveal that the stollen shipment is being stored on the second story of a guarded warehouse owned by The Baker's Sons in a small room that is only accessible by a secret door from the accountant's office or through a hatch in the floor of the building's top level. If the players press for it the accountant's office has a window and the third floor has a balcony that can be reached from the roof of the blacksmith's shop next door. The warehouse has a number of guards who will be supervised by one member of the order at night and at least three other members of the order may be there during the day, including the accountant, the warehouse supervisor, and captain of the order Melia daughter of Neera who keeps a second office on the ground level that she often uses to get some peace and quite away from the order's headquarters.

## Scene Three: Breaking in
The character's choose how to enter the warehouse navigating at their own peril until they've found the <PACKAGE> Sire Klees sent them for. The character's may search for other loot while in the warehouse. See Map figure one for outside the building and Map figure two for inside the building. The character's need only get the <PACKAGE> and get out.

First Floor:
    1. The main storage area is filled with piled up barrels and crates, it's open with a high ceiling; the stacks of items do not reach the ceiling but are tall enough to block the character's view.
    2. Panty and kitchen, this room has food and prep supplies; there's a good chance at least one guard is in here.
    3.
    4.
    5. Wagon entrance, this drop down is where wagons would pull in to be loaded and unloaded while out of the weather and away from prying eyes. There is a small lift operated by a hand crank next to this area.
Second Floor:
    6. Second story storage area is much like the first but with a lower ceiling, the stacked barrels and crates reach all the way to the ceiling.
    7. This room may once have been an office but has become additional storage space. Some more valuable items may be stored in here if the party takes the time to search it.
    8. Accountant's office, filled with ledgers and scrolls.
    9. Quartermaster's office, contains a number of areas for soldiers to sit, a single desk with a ledger as well as some weapon cleaning and repair tools.
    10. Weapon's locker, filled with locked racks and chests of weapons, the metal weapons are locked up but but staves, clubs, bows, and the like are available to easily grab.
    11. Captains office, the door is locked and the room is filled with the comforts afforded to a captain of the Baker's Sons. A tidy desk sit in the center surrounded by bookshelves and with a seating area off to the side, remnants of yesterday's dinner still on the table.
    12. Accountant's closet, filled with shelves of scrolls and old ledgers there is a hidden door in the back of the closet.
    13. Hidden room containing nothing but the illicit package stollen from Sire Klees.
Third Floor:
    14. Top story storage, much like the lower two floors main areas this large room is filled with barrels and crates.
    15. Outer Storage, this section of the building is covered but has no walls, some items are stored out here. The small lift in one corner is matched by a crane with hand crank in the opposite to bring crates directly from the ally to to the roof. The roof is angled in such a way that when it rains all the water is emptied into the corner pool and piped into the rest of the warehouse. 
    16. Barracks, though the warehouse is not meant to house soldiers there is a room with a handful of beds, at least one of will be taken by a guard trying to grab a nap on the job.

## Scene Four: Ambush
When the character's go to meet Sire Klees, preferable in the ally behind the inn to avoid attracting to much attention they give the package to Klees who is present with Seera and Rallin. As soon as the package is handed off the group is confronted by robed men from both ends of the ally one of them fires off a crossbow bolt at Rollin bringing him to his knees and another cast a spell engulfing him in flame. Klees shouts that the party must have been followed and that he'll have the Baker's head for this, after which combat ensues.

Seera reminds the party that it's a bad idea to leave an ally full of bodies and to keep to their non-lethal weaponry if they wish to keep the law off their backs.

After the fight is over and the Baker's Sons flee or are incapacitated Klees asks that the party accompanies Seera to Proto to finish her mission now that Rallin is to injured to do it himself. He promises to double his initial offer of pay and cut them in for one percent of the delivery each.
