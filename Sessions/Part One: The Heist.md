#### Scene One: Meeting With Sire Yakob Klees
The characters gather at The Pick and Key, a local tavern, at lunch time in response to a summons from local Land-Owner (lowest rank of Askelonian Lord), and suspected gang leader, Sire Yakob Klees.

As the character's enter there is a regular lunch crowd but no sign of of the Sire, if they ask the Cedren he'll inform them they are to wait and ask if they want food or ale while they do.  

After the characters have a chance to chat or gossip Rallin appears from the back room cleaning a long knife that appears to have blood on it and calls the party members in.

The back room is 20'x 30' with a number of small tables around the parameter and a small bar along part of the left wall, a single larger table in the center and two additional doors off the right rear and behind the bar. Klees is seated at the large table, Seera the bar looking on and a handful of guards, both Sapeen and Kaazt, standing around. The seat at the table closest the entrance is smeared with recently mopped up blood.

Klees bellows out a greeting and asks the party to take a seat, offering refreshments and calling for food.

After the party settles Klees explains how he had a important chest that was hidden in a shipment that got raided by The Baker's Sons. The chest was arcanely locked and he knows the mages would charge him more than he's willing to pay for it's return and he's unwilling to start a war by going after it himself but he knows of individual who was involved and may know where the chest where being kept; Leorg is an ally of the Order but not a mage himself, he's cautious and knows Klees's men but not the party. Leorg is known to frequent a local tavern and gambling hall called The Hard Six.

#### Scene Two: Tracking Leorg
The party should investigate Leorg's whereabouts, ultimately tracking him to a back room card table at The Hard Six. Leorg will be drunk and, if not confronted first head to the back ally to relieve himself. The party can apprehend and question him however they see fit. He wont be willingly forthcoming with the information but will brag about the raided caravan if he feels he's being praised or will quickly spill his guts if threatened with violence.

Leorg will reveal that the stollen shipment is being stored on the second story of a guarded warehouse owned by The Baker's Sons in a small room that is only accessible by a secret door from the accountant's office or through a hatch in the floor of the building's top level. If the players press for it the accountant's office has a window and the third floor has a balcony that can be reached from the roof of the blacksmith's shop next door. The warehouse has a number of guards who will be supervised by one member of the order at night and at least three other members of the order may be there during the day, including the accountant, the warehouse supervisor, and captain of the order Melia daughter of Neera who keeps a second office on the ground level that she often uses to get some peace and quite away from the order's headquarters.
