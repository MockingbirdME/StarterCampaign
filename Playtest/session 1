- Players track Ryn to his house, small two room fisherman's house with a small outbuilding that looks to be a mostly underground shed.
- Ryn refuses to go with the players and fires a crossbow at them before drawing a dagger to fight. He won't go willingly and won't surrender.
- After the fight a boy yells for his father, begs the players to spare him. He doesn't know anything but says his mum disappeared a few weeks ago and dad just said "they'd be with her soon."
- In the house they find a few letters
    - "I've been able to dig down to the old tunnels, they're really there! I hid the entrance under a hay stack in the back barn, Mr. Rendor and his family never come back here only us hands and we're all in this together."
    - "The witch says there are tunnels deep below the island, Teejee tunnels she claims; I didn't know Candlehiem ever had Teejee but she says she divined the location and if we can gain entrance we'll have access to any part of the isle without being noticed."
    - "Passage question: To keep this you must first give it."
    - "Those brutes murdered the men we sent, this will almost certainly push Cisero to war, you are tasked with murdering Thissel to ensure Lady Lynn doesn't attempt to sue for peace first. Make sure to coat your blade first to ensure death with a single strike."
- The outbuilding is locked if the players find out where the key is hidden from the boy the can enter fine, if they force the door open they trigger a trap:
    - a vial drops and breaks unleashing a cloud of gas that quickly expands before dissipating. Players make a difficulty 15 Mind + Discipline check or are terrified for a few minutes seeing monsters constantly in the corner of their vision. Passing the check allows them to stay composed. A player who passed the check or wasn't affected can make a Mind + Discipline + Command check to try to calm other players.
  The shed contains a small table with cooking equipment, a single vial of black liquid and one filled with a green paste. There is a piece of paper with two recipes on it only one ingredient is missing for the paste recipe but there are no remaining ingredients for the black one.
  Either player who was injured by Ryn starts to feel weak and experiences burning at the wound point; black tendrils can be visibly seen snacking out from the wound. There is just enough green paste to treat each of them.
