# WORLD
* Two moons, one that cycles once per season and one that cycles for 28 days with irregular new/full timing. The calendar is set by the moons.
* There are many Gods but they don't appear to take direct action in the world (anymore), and aren't generally worshiped outside of a few pocket cults.
* "Dragon" is a term that relates to the strain tor'leni and all of the various creatures they have spawned via failed transformation (some of these are monstrous).


# Island (Candlehiem)
* Ruled by the nation of Galabrain but distant enough that it's barely important enough to be assigned a governor; a tor'leni named Jaadira.
* Grows corn and oranges and trades primarily with sailors traveling from Galabrain or further south to Askelon or the Northern Reaches.
* Mostly populated by sapeen and denja with the few tor'leni being part of the governor's retinue.


# Starting Town (Kelsp)
* Ruled by "Lady Lynn" Orso a sapeen in her middle years.
* Law is kept by Lady Lynn's two lieutenants Thissel and Herrold both sapeen men in their thirties.
* Small temple to Clurses (God of wind and weather, the cleanser, creator of the sapeen, storm-father, lifegiver) run by Olard an elderly denja.
