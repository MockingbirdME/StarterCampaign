- Players track _Ryn_ to his house, small two room fisherman's house with a small outbuilding that looks to be a mostly underground shed.
- _Ryn_ refuses to go with the players and fires a crossbow at them before drawing a dagger to fight. He won't go willingly and won't surrender.
- After the fight a boy (_Little Ryn_) yells for his father, begs the players to spare him. He doesn't know anything but says his mum disappeared a few weeks ago and dad just said "they'd be with her soon."
- In the house they find a few letters
    - "I've been able to dig down to the old tunnels, they're really there! I hid the entrance under a hay stack in the back barn, _Mr. Rendor_ and his family never come back here only us hands and we're all in this together."
    - "The witch says there are tunnels deep below the island, Teejee tunnels she claims; I didn't know Candlehiem ever had Teejee but she says she divined the location and if we can gain entrance we'll have access to any part of the isle without being noticed."
    - "Passage question: To keep this you must first give it." along with a runic symbol.
    - "Those brutes murdered the men we sent, this will almost certainly push _Cicero_ to war, you are tasked with murdering _Thissel_ to ensure Lady Lynn doesn't attempt to sue for peace first. Make sure to coat your blade first to ensure death with a single strike."
- The outbuilding is locked if the players find out where the key is hidden from the boy the can enter fine, if they force the door open they trigger a trap:
    - a vial drops and breaks unleashing a cloud of gas that quickly expands before dissipating. Players make a difficulty 15 Mind + Discipline check or are terrified for a few minutes seeing monsters constantly in the corner of their vision. Passing the check allows them to stay composed. A player who passed the check or wasn't affected can make a Mind + Discipline + Command check to try to calm other players.
  The shed contains a small table with cooking equipment, a single vial of black liquid and one filled with a green paste. There is a piece of paper with two recipes on it only one ingredient is missing for the paste recipe but there are no remaining ingredients for the black one.
  Either player who was injured by _Ryn_ starts to feel weak and experiences burning at the wound point; black tendrils can be visibly seen snacking out from the wound. There is just enough green paste to treat each of them.

- In town:
    - Can find _Yenn_ on the way to town sparing with the boys. Otherwise can find _Lady Lynn_ in the great hall along with a dying _Thissel_ and _Marta Stone_ the local healer who is trying to treat him. Any of these characters can read the notes for the players and explain where the _Render Farm_ is.
    - They can also find _Torn_ the sailor who hired them them to help previously and _Sweet Will_ the quartermaster who taught _Geoff_ to play Fisherman's Cup, they are fixing their boat following the storm but more importantly are convinced that the sailors from another ship (The one's who kept to themselves in the greathall during the storm) are in fact pirates and offer a full bar as payment for proof. Both ships were damaged and will take a week or three to fix depending on supplies being brought in from inland.
    - _Olard_ the denja priest of Clurses who claims to be having visions of disaster brought on by men and not the end times prophesied by the gods when The seers close their books for a final time. He claims a vision of a sapeen woman with arms of dragons and a wyvren perched upon her head.
    - If the players attempt to speak to anyone else they'll hear rumors of farm hands and shepherds not being seen for some time, many of whom seem to have disappeared after the storm.

- If the players go to the _Render Farm_ they may encounter the following:
    - There are 3 farmhands who act as scouts for the subterranean complex.
    - The barn with the entrance is guarded by 2 more farmhands.
    - The tunnel can be found easily under the barn but it dead ends into a door of stone with faintly glowing runes upon it, if the party brought a character who can read the words "Answer your question" are written above the 2 score individual runes one of which is the same as marked on the letter found at _Ryn's_ house.
    - If the players fail to solve the riddle they can attempt to capture another farm hand who comes to investigate, the farm hand runs and a body + personal movement + run chase ensues.
    - the tunnel leads into a larger chamber with a few guards chatting and gambling and another cooking a stew over an open fire.
    - A tunnel to the left leads into another chamber obviously converted into a sleeping area.
    - A tunnel to the right is a much longer snaking hallway that has many collapsed tunnels forking from it. The hallway ends in an ornate chamber with a few Tor'joven soldiers and two sapeen women, one older with a long knife the other barely past majority with long wavy black hair and a stylized, fresh, tattoo around her neck that looks to continue down below the shift she's wearing who is bound to the wall with shackles and bleeding from a few long cuts draining her blood into a pair of silver bowls with large amounts of burning smokey incense around her. The older women commands the Tor'joven to attack and supports them with spells fleeing if the fight goes sour and using some magic to collapse the tunnel behind her.
        - Witch:
            Arcane Powers:
                - **Energize** - short, healing or lighting, all mages
                  * (1+) - target character regains X stamina plus X per additional success spent, the character then suffers one fatigue plus one for every three additional successes spent on this power.
                - **Shape Matter** - short, matter, all mages
                  * (varies) - target up to X cubic decimeters of stone or dead wood, X cubic centimeters of soft metal (coper, bronze, iron), or X cubic millimeters of hard metal (steel) and shape it to your will. The number of successes needed depend on how much the substance has already been worked, wooden boards or stone blocks require only one success, worked stone or wood require 4 successes, and forged metal requires 8 successes. Additional successes can be spent to increase the volume affected by up to 1 deci/centi/millimeter depending on the substance affected.
                - **Force Barrier** - short, force, all mages
                  (1+) - create a shield or wall of pure force X meters square and shaped as the caster wishes; the barrier has a body and armor value of X and may hold back 100X pounds and lasts for X rounds. Additional successes may be spent to increase the body or armor value by one each or one success can be used to allow the mage to move the barrier as a shield while it lasts providing 3 times X cover bonus (max 9). The barrier has its armor value reduced by two whenever it is bypassed and by one for each wound it would suffer from non-penetrating damage, the barrier is destroyed if its armor value is ever reduced to zero. A target just beyond a force barrier takes damage if the barrier’s armor was bypassed with added damage reduction of the barrier’s armor before the reduction caused by the attack.
