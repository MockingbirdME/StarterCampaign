Character's live in the outskirts of Kelsp and are frequently given trouble by the men of Tyron Relnt, leader of the neighboring town of Pelto. The larger town feels that it rightfully governs both itself and Kelsp and often sends men to collect "taxes" that are owed to the government. This has been going on for years but the dispute is considered small enough that the governor has not gotten involved.

The character's are working outside when a young girl (Yenn), maybe 12 cycles old, comes running up huffing and puffing about a coming storm and that they need to get to the great hall for safety, she also mentions that she saw the two men that beat up old man Riccard last week and took his day's catch as back taxes to Relnt coming their way.

She has two more houses to go warn and worries there isn't time before the storm hits. The Yorn family (denja) need are likely all out in their orchard gathering fruit and weren't at home and the widow Eirn who lives alone in the hills. She asks if the players can help with the warnings.

The players end up either at the great hall or out in the storm. At the great hall Thissel is knifed and murdered and a hooded sapeen man flees into the storm; the players see him flee either from in the safety of the hall or as they approach it.
