Cooking skill check - mind + survival skill check if without the cooking profession skill.

Thorn's ship "Greasy Maiden"

Cliff - guard left alive.






Game issues:
- Defense and Stamina are to complicated to keep track of; consider having only one effected by most any given action.
- Stuns aren't working well, they need some real work or potentially to be removed.
- Body hit locations work pretty well but need to be simpler and may need to be renamed to avoid having it seem like you can't deal a ton of damage with an axe to the face.
- Wound penalties felt good.
- Fulled by Pain trait feels underwhelming.
- Initiative works well but feels bad to keep track of/calculate each round.
- Melee/ranged defense bonus, parry bonus, and cover/shield bonus may be to many things.

- Need to flesh out a tackle and bull rush attack type.
- Need to flesh out stealth skill checks.
